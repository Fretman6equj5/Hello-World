Hello World Test


Hi, I'm John.  Not sure if this will ever be read by a human other than myself, but just in case I'll follow the directions. I'm learning how to program.  I've loved programming ever since I was in high school (13 years ago) and I've always imagined that this is how I would make my living.  I've been working with my hands for long enough now, building skills and learning to be self sufficient.  But now it's time to move onto serious work.  Up until now this has been a hobby, but I know it is a powerful tool in this world and I'm excited to dive in a learn how everything works.  Bring it.
